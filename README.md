# Esperanto x-sistemo converter
 This is a stream editor converter from X-system (x-sistemo) to Esperanto letters with diacritical marks. To make this script work for a file written in x-sistemo (file.txt) use the following commands:
- `chmod +x epox.sed`
- `sed -i -f epox.sed file.txt`

The script will go through each of these to convert them.  When reading the modified script please, make sure that the editor is adjusted to utf-8 encoding.
